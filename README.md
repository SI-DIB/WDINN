# WDINN
 
Welcome to the official repository for Weibull Distribution-Informed Neural Networks (WDINN), a groundbreaking framework designed to address stochastic uncertainties and non-linearities in lithium-ion battery degradation. WDINN bridges data-driven and physics-based modeling approaches to enhance the accuracy of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions and operational insights for lithium-ion batteries.

The dataset is originally taken from: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yz4pttm73n/2

Key Features
1. Weibull Loss Function: Integrates the probabilistic properties of Weibull distribution to account for stochastic behaviors in battery degradation.

2. Enhanced Performance: Outperforms state-of-the-art models like Bi-LSTM, Attention LSTM, GRU, and ANN in both rapid pulse and aging datasets.

3. Clustering-Based Analysis: Enables detailed evaluation of degradation regimes, uncovering operational complexities and providing robust predictive maintenance insights.

4. Interpretable Results: Supports clustering and feature contribution analyses using t-SNE and radar plots for better understanding of degradation patterns.
